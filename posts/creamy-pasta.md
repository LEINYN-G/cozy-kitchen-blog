7. Stir in all-purpose flour. Sauté well until the flour loses the raw smell (don’t brown the flour).  
8. Turn off the heat, slowly pour 1/2 cup milk while stirring.  
9. Turn on the heat and cook on medium-low until the white sauce becomes thick. Pour the heavy cream or cheese and mix well.  
10. If it’s thick enough to coat the back of a spoon—congrats!!
